# The Problem Set

The problems are in `hw1.tex` which is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler.

# Submission

There are 2 parts to this assignment.

## 1.1 Solving the Problem Set

Insert your solutions in `solution` environments in `hw1.tex`. The file named `hw1.tex` in your GitHub repository at the time of the deadline will be considered your team's submission. Make sure that any included files, e.g. image files, are also present in the repository.
